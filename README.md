# Wave intensity/separation analysis in R

This R script separates the blood pressure waveform into its forward and backward traveling components using simultaneously measured blood pressure and flow waves sampled at 200hz.

To run the function:
```R
ans <- WaveAnalyses(mydata$pressure, 
                    mydata$flow, 
                    align = FALSE,   # time align the pressure & flow wave?
                    plot = TRUE)     # Plot results?
```

Set `align = TRUE` if presure and flow curves require time alignment.
<br/><br/>

If `plot = TRUE` Results will be sent to the plot tab for inspection:

The function returns the following values:
